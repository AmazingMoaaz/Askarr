# Askarr Brand Guidelines

## Logo

The Askarr logo consists of a stylized "A" shape with a chat bubble and signal waves, representing the application's function as a media request chatbot. The logo should always be displayed clearly and with adequate spacing around it.

### Logo Variations

- **Primary Logo**: Full color logo on dark or light backgrounds
- **Icon Only**: For small spaces like app icons and favicons
- **Logo with Text**: For headers, banners and promotional materials

### Clear Space

Always maintain a minimum clear space around the logo. This space should be equal to the height of the "A" in the logo.

### Minimum Size

To ensure legibility, the logo should not be displayed smaller than:
- 32px height for digital applications
- 10mm height for print applications

## Typography

### Primary Font

**Arial** (or Helvetica/Sans-serif alternatives)
- Bold for headings
- Regular for body text
- Italic for emphasis

## Color Palette

See [color_palette.md](color_palette.md) for detailed color specifications.

## Design Elements

### Signal Waves

The signal wave motif can be used as a decorative element to reinforce the communication aspect of the brand.

### Rounded Corners

All UI elements should use rounded corners to maintain a friendly, approachable feel.

## Tone of Voice

### Brand Personality

- **Helpful**: Askarr is a service-oriented application that aims to simplify media requests
- **Efficient**: The communication should be clear and to the point
- **Technical but accessible**: While Askarr deals with technical integrations, its communication should be understandable to users of all technical levels

### Writing Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Avoid jargon where possible, but use technical terms where appropriate
- Use an active voice
- Be friendly but professional

## Application in UI

### Button Styles

Secondary buttons should use Light Blue (#63B3ED) or outlines.

### Icons

Interface icons should be simple, consistent in style, and use the brand colors.

### Backgrounds

Use Dark Blue (#2D3748) for primary backgrounds and white or light gray for content areas.
